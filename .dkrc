# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram              # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch        # watch files and re-run tests or other commands
dk use: shell-console     # make the "console" command enter a subshell
dk use: bash-kit          # enable doing tests/console/etc. in other bash versions
dk use: shellcheck        # support running shellcheck (via docker if not installed)

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

on "cram_files" ls README.md specs/*.cram.md

# SC2016 = expressions in single quotes
# SC2145 = prefix or suffix on "$@" or other array
SHELLCHECK_OPTS='-e SC2016,SC2145'

before "test" export PATH="$LOCO_ROOT:$PATH"  # put bashup.events on PATH
on     "test" shellcheck bashup.events
